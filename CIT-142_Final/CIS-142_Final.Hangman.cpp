/* Purpose: Create the video game hangman in the command prompt while meeting the following requirements:
 Require the user to input letters only. Allow upper or lower case letters.
 Randomly select between at least 5 words for the user to guess. Keep a theme (e.g. animals, foods, philosophers, etc).
 All words should be at least 5 characters.
 Display a message when the user incorrectly guesses a letter.
 Display a message when the user correctly guesses a letter.
 Display all previously guessed letters so the user doesn't guess them again.
 Allow the user to incorrectly answer 6 times before displaying a game over message. (head, body, arms, legs)
 Display a congratulations message if the user wins.
 Prompt the user to play again once their game is over.
 Display correctly guessed letters with Xs in place of the unguessed letters (e.g. ProXraXXinX = Programming with G and M unguessed)
 You don't have to draw the actual hanging man.
